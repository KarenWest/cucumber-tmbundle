h1. Textmate Bundle for Cucumber

Hi,
Aslak Helles√∏y and Dr. Nic Williams are now maintaining this project.

Please install and refer to "Aslak's fork":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber-tmbundle for updates/tickets.
If you already have the bundle installed with my fork you can use the "Update Cucumber Bundle" menu item followed
by the "Switch to New Canonical Fork" item once it is updated.

I have been working on this project since May 2008 (originally for the RSpec Story Runner) and it has been
a lot of fun and rewarding.  I no longer use TextMate though so I decided to hand it over to people who
are still avid TextMate users and will give it the proper attention and love it deserves. :)

So long, and thanks for all the fish!

-Ben
